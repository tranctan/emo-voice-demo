# emotional_voice_conversion
Nothing fancy, just basic algorithms on extracting, transforming and resembling pitch to generate different emotional voices (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

The method here is a combination of adjusting the energy, speed, and pitch of the original speech audio, to mimic the target emotion.  This method is quite simple, hence, some target emotion is not precisely reflected (compared to some Deep Learning-based approaches).

However, this can act as a rule-based result for Emotional Voice Conversion to compare with other DL-based methods, as this approach does not require any training data.
